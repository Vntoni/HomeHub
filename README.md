**Home Station**

**HW**: Rasperry Pi 5, Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2 (7'')

**Frontend**: QML

**Backend**: Python, PyQT6

**Plan to integrate**:
- AC units (API connection, Control of temperature, Modes, reading the room temperature, working automation in summer/winter) ✔
- Electric heaters (API connection, Control of temperature, Modes, reading the room temperature, working automation in summer/winter) ❌ 
- Water Heater (API connection, Control of temperature, Modes, reading the room temperature, working automation in summer/winter) ✔
- Waher Machine (BLE connection, Check state of washing (on/off), check and display washing time) ✔
- Power consumption (API connection, get and save the data of hourly, daily, and monthly power consumption) ❌
- Weather station (Build and connect to small wather/garden station to read data from sensors(air pollution, humidity, temperature) ❌
- PV panels (get and save the data of Power production from PV panels) ❌

**Further plans to develop**:
- AI voice agent integration - controlling the APP through voice
- Add tests
